## What is Muwanx?

**Muwanx** is a lightweight, browser-based reinforcement learning demo web application built with [mujoco_wasm](https://github.com/zalo/mujoco_wasm/) and [ONNX Runtime Web](https://www.onnxruntime.ai/docs/build/web.html). This allows you to run MuJoCo simulations in real-time with trained policies controlling entirely client-side. Ideal for sharing interactive demos as a static site (e.g., hosting on GitHub Pages), prototyping policies, or building customizable RL playgrounds directly in the browser.

## Features

- Real-time control of MuJoCo simulations with trained policies
- Apply force to the simulation for testing robustness of the policies
- Change the state of the goal that policies reference
- Fully client-side execution using MuJoCo compiled in WebAssembly and ONNX Runtime Web
- Easy to share and host as a static site (e.g., GitHub Pages)
- Customizable reinforcement learning playgrounds

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ttktjmt/muwanx.git
cd muwanx

npm install
npm run dev
# access the localhost URL shown in the terminal
