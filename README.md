**Muwanx** is a reinforcement learning demo web application built with [mujoco_wasm](https://github.com/zalo/mujoco_wasm/) and [ONNX Runtime Web](https://www.onnxruntime.ai/docs/build/web.html). This allows you to run MuJoCo simulations in real-time with trained policies controlling entirely client-side. Ideal for sharing interactive demos as a static site (e.g., hosting on GitHub Pages), prototyping policies, or building customizable RL playgrounds directly in the browser.

## Features
- **Real-time**: Run MuJoCo simulations with real-time policy control.
- **Interactive**: Change the state of objects by applying forces.
- **Client-only**: All computation runs in the browser. No server for simulation required.
- **Easy Sharing**: Host as a static site for effortless demo distribution (e.g., GitHub Pages).
- **Customizable**: Add your own MuJoCo models and ONNX policies quickly.

## Quick Start

To run muwanx locally, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, then execute the following commands in your terminal.

Clone the repository on your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ttktjmt/muwanx.git
cd muwanx
```

Install the dependencies and start the development server:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to the localhost URL shown in the terminal to see Muwanx in action.
